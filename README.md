Please click on the directory called GCDProject underneath GCDCourseProject repo to see BOTH files --- run_analysis.R and codebook.Rmd --- I will attempt to fix and put both under the main directory. Git is my nemesis, I cannot seem to make it do what I want. THANK YOU!

There are two main files in this repo. First is the run_analysis script. This file reads in required data zip file from the web site, unzips files, merges various files together, cleans up and provides descriptive column names, provides descriptive labels for activities that are part of observations and then creates an independent data set that summarizes averages for each of the value variables in the original file for each subject and activity in the study.

For lots (and I mean lots) more detail on exactly how the code works, please see the codebook.Rmd file also located in this repository.

Here is a link to the original raw data: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip]
